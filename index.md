## About 
I am a professional dancer and Ph.D. student in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at the University of Miami. I received my M.A. in English and Comparative Literature from the American University in Cairo. My doctoral research focuses on contemporary Latinx social dances, investigating how their movements reflect larger iterations of movement, such as diaspora, identity, and cultural and corporeal memory.
